      <h2>Who is Nairaa?</h2>
      <p>
        Nairaa, a blend of my husband's name and mine, has always been an immense source of joy and inspiration for me. Created after the birth of my little bundle of joy, Nairaa's Art and Crafts is a small business specializing in arts and crafts. We focus on personalized gift items, including resin art showcasing various products and painting & calligraphy on canvas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the foundation of Nairaa's Art and Crafts on 27th July 2020, we have brought huge smiles to our dear clients through our personalized products. Being someone who loves art and crafts, I always enjoy launching new products and experimenting with new models. Despite leading a very hectic life along with being a wife and a mother, I always try my best to meet the expectations of my clients. Sometimes, I have to spend sleepless nights just to complete my orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing a small business is not only a long-cherished dream; it also allows me to find solace in art. Through this business venture, all I want is more exposure to a greater audience and to provide quality art/products to all my customers.
